Log Classifier (Individual Project)
A command-line tool built with Java to process diverse log streams from a text file. It efficiently parses, categorizes, and aggregates log data into structured JSON files for analysis.

Features:

Leverages the Chain of Responsibility design pattern for decoupled and extensible log handling.

Processes three distinct log types: Application Performance Monitoring (APM), Application, and web server Requests.

Performs complex aggregations: calculates min/median/average/max for APM metrics, counts log levels for Application logs, and computes response time percentiles for Request logs.

Technologies: Java, Gradle, JUnit, Mockito, Google Gson, Apache Commons Math.

Expense Tracker
Architected and delivered a full-stack, production-ready application using a microservices approach deployed on AWS. 

Developed scalable backend RESTful APIs with 

Spring Boot and utilized Kafka for real-time, asynchronous messaging between services. 

Implemented robust security using JWT-based authentication, role-based access control with Spring Security, and an API Gateway. 

Established a complete CI/CD pipeline with 

GitHub Actions and containerized the application with Docker for consistency. 


Tech Stack: Spring Boot, React Native, AWS, Docker, Microservices, Kafka. 

Open Table (Group Project)
Collaborated on a full-stack restaurant reservation application using Next.js, Spring Boot, MySQL, and Docker. 

Led development of the Admin Dashboard, enabling restaurant management, approval workflows, and reservation analytics.
